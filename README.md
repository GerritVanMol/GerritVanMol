### Hi there 👋

I am Gerrit, a 23-year-old motivated student at the Vives College and a graduated student of Odisee University in Belgium.
My passion is building computers and discovering novelties.
In the future, I would like to become an expert DevOps engineer with a skillset of the developer side. 
In my spare time, you will find me on the KLJ or outside with my pets.
